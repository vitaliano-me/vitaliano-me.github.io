<h4 id="tech-lead-and-software-designer-at-globant--são-paulo">Tech Lead and Software Designer at Globant | São Paulo</h4>
<h5 id="july-2022november-2023">July 2022—November 2023</h5>
<p class="indentation-level-1">During my time at Globant, I led a distributed team of seven engineers across three countries to deliver key features for EA’s flagship titles. On <strong>FIFA Online 4</strong> (<a href="https://fifaonline4.nexon.com">fifaonline4.nexon.com</a>), I collaborated daily with EA Korea stakeholders, proposing and implementing architectural solutions, managing workloads, and achieving early feature delivery for the first time in the project’s history. I designed and developed the exclusive <em>Club Capture</em> mode for mobile, leveraging ActionScript 3 for client-side functionality and Node.js for server-side logic, while also enhancing the project’s maintainability by redefining class responsibilities.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">Additionally, I contributed to <strong>UFC 5</strong> (<a href="https://ea.com/games/ufc/ufc-5">ea.com/games/ufc/ufc-5</a>), focusing on fixing UI bugs using ActionScript 3 and Lua, which improved game stability and the user experience. Beyond technical contributions, I mentored two developers, fostering their growth, and authored Frostbite Engine documentation and tutorials to enhance team onboarding and efficiency.</p>

<p class="indentation-level-1">During my time at Fanatee, I worked on mobile game development in Unity, leading technical initiatives and delivering impactful projects. I spearheaded the development of the <strong>Fanatee Game Framework</strong>, a modular system now used by all game teams at the company. This Framework includes UPM packages for features shared across games, such as Apple and Google store integrations, ad services, analytics, server communication, push notifications, and build automation. Collaborating with the Technical Director, I redesigned the <strong>Word Lanes</strong> architecture, introducing a dynamic mocking layer for server responses that enhanced flexibility in testing.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">I worked closely with the Monetization team to optimize ad placement metrics and addressed Ad Provider API changes. Additionally, I improved user data collection processes to comply with Apple’s updated privacy policies, collaborating with the User Acquisition team.

<h5 id="april-2016december-2019">April 2016–December 2019</h5>
<p class="indentation-level-1">At MediaMonks, I collaborated with teams across the U.S., Brazil, and the Netherlands to develop cutting-edge VR and interactive experiences using Unity3D. My work included creating Arduino and Raspberry Pi firmware in C++11, server-side and scripting solutions in Python, and applications using Electron, C#, and Node.js. As needed, I took on full-stack development responsibilities, handling both front-end and back-end tasks.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">On the <strong>Amazon Prime Video: Jack Ryan Experience</strong> (<a href="https://bit.ly/ComicConJackRyan">bit.ly/ComicConJackRyan</a>), I developed VR-to-interactables network integration using C++ and Unity3D, along with firmware development in C++.

<p class="indentation-level-1">During my time at D3, I contributed to innovative projects, combining hardware and software solutions to deliver unique user experiences.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">For the <strong>Bloom Experience at Rock in Rio 2015</strong> (<a href="https://vimeo.com/144893114">video</a>), I developed a system in C++98 using a Raspberry Pi to capture user images remotely and deliver them by the end of the experience. I also collaborated with <strong>Google Zoo</strong> on a project analyzing city traffic patterns during holidays to determine optimal travel times.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">My role included developing ARM/Raspberry Pi firmware in C++98, creating front-end and back-end systems with Node.js, and conducting product research and development (R&amp;D).</p>

<p class="indentation-level-1">While at FLAG.CX, I worked on various innovative projects, combining firmware development and real-time data visualization.</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">I developed firmware in C++98 for an Atmel chip that synced with a Google Cloud service I created using Python. This system automatically opened the <strong>Experiment Box</strong> (<a href="https://andrei.cc/images/works/sciencebox/experience.mp4">video</a>) when new videos were uploaded to the Manual Do Mundo YouTube channel. I also developed C++98 firmware for a BeagleBone board to sync five motion sensors, creating an upper body skeleton rig and transmitting the data to Unity 3D for real-time visualization of movements in 3D (<a href="https://www.latinspots.com//comerciales/anteriores/SandroDias_Rexona_CamisetaTecnologica.mp4">video</a>).</p>
<p class="indentation-level-1">Additionally, I created a VR video player in Unity 3D for the <strong>Doritos For the Bold</strong> campaign experience using the Oculus Rift DK1, and I developed a multi-touch surface using C++11 on an Arduino board to control infrared sensors for touch and movement detection in the <strong>Samsung Galaxy.ME</strong> campaign.</p>
