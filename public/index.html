<hr>
<p>Lead Game Developer at Fanatee | São Paulo
March 2020–May 2022</p>
<p>A great example of my leadership skills is my work on the Fanatee Game Framework. After identifying some challenges in the Word Lanes architecture, I worked with the company&rsquo;s Technical Director to develop a more elegant solution. For example, the Framework had a tool to mock server responses by using a folder structure with JSON files, but some features required more dynamic mocking, so I&rsquo;ve created a layer where the developer can register a class that will handle the specific endpoint request, allowing us to have dynamic responses in a mocked environment. The Framework was composed of multiple layers and many Editor tools. All features that are shared between our games were isolated and turned into UPM packages, for example: Apple and Google Stores communications, Ad Service, Analytics, Server Communication, Push Notification, Build Automation and many more.</p>
<p>Delivered and maintained a successful game framework, and it is now used by all the company&rsquo;s game teams.
Managed and communicated the architecture decisions to the team and helped them understand how to use the Framework effectively.
Worked closely with the Monetization team to improve the ad placement metrics and handle the usual Ad Provider API changes.
Improved the user data collection to abide by Apple&rsquo;s Privacy Policy update with the User Acquisition team.
